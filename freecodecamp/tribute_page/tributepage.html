    <h4>Life of Avicii</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Born in Stockholm, Sweden on September 8, 1989</li>
      <li>Started making music at age 16 and remixed a number of classic songs while posting his work  on electronic music forums</li>
      <li>By 2010, Avicii started working as a small-time DJ, remixing for artists such as Little Boots and Robyn. Meanwhile, he continued to release his own singles, such as ‘Bromance’ and ‘My Feelings for You.’ ‘Seek Bromance,’ the remixed version of his single ‘Bromance,’ with vocals by Amanda Wilson, was a huge success.</li>
      <li>His initial successes got Avicii acquainted with the right people in the music industry. By 2011, he had already finished working on his breakthrough single, ‘Levels.’ The song included vocals from the famous gospel-inspired 60s song ‘Something’s got a Hold on Me’ by Etta James. ‘Levels’ made waves nationally and internationally and established Avicii in the mainstream music arena. The song made its place among the top 10 hits of many European countries and also made waves across the US.</li>
      <li>The album ‘True’ was released in late 2013 and featured several established artists, such as Nile Rodgers and Adam Lambert. A few more songs from the album, such as ‘Hey Brother’ and ‘Addicted to You,’ became successful, and the album was certified “platinum” by the ‘Recording Industry Association of America’ (RIAA). The following year, Avicii released the club remix version of the album, ‘True: Avicii by Avicii.’ The same year, he collaborated with Chris Martin from the legendary rock band ‘Coldplay,’ for the single ‘A Sky Full of Stars.’</li>
      <li>In late 2015, Avicii released his second album, ‘Stories,’ and merged pop music with electronic sounds. The album reached the top of the ‘Billboard’ dance chart. Some of his other successful singles from this period were a remix of Nina Simone’s classic jazz song ‘Feeling Good,’ ‘Tracks of my Tears,’ ‘Divine Sorrow,’ and ‘Heaven.’</li>
      <li>On April 20, 2018, his lifeless body was found in his hotel room near Muscat, Oman. A few days later, his family revealed that he had cut himself and bled to death. With Avicii’s suicide, another bright star of the music industry dimmed forever. The concept of the “tortured artist” had once again made its presence felt. He was 28 years old at the time of his death, but his music shall always remain ageless and immortal.</li>
